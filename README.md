# Personal Finance Tracker ðŸ’°

This project is a web application for tracking personal finances, built using Streamlit, Plotly, and MongoDB. The application allows users to input their income and expenses, store them in a MongoDB database, and visualize the data using interactive charts.

## Features

- **Data Entry**: Users can input their income and expenses for each month, categorize them, and add comments. The data is stored in a MongoDB database via the MongoDB Data API.
- **Data Visualization**: Users can visualize their income and expenses for selected periods using interactive Sankey charts, which help in understanding the flow of money.

## Technologies Used

- **Streamlit**: Used for creating the web application interface.
- **Plotly**: Used for generating interactive charts and visualizations.
- **MongoDB**: Used as the database for storing income and expense records.
- **Python**: Core programming language used for the backend logic.
- **Streamlit Option Menu**: Used for creating a user-friendly navigation menu.
